What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. block scope.
VAriable scope is the rule set that allows certain coded areas, to be accessed by particular variables. 
Global scope (unpreferred) is a varialbe that can be accessed from anywhere. As to block is different in that it is included or paired with the function to accessed exclusivly there.  
Why are global variables avoided?
When it uses a variable apart of another function or out on its own, it begins to cause side effects. 
Explain JavaScript's strict mode
This is put at the top of the JavaScript file, used to ensure that all variables are declared with "const" or "let". If neither are used then an error occurs. 
What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
A side effect is when a function goes from its local scope and into a parent's, where it alters a values inhabiting it.
A pure function is when a function has no side effects as well as determinate.
